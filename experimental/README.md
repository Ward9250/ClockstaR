# To implement

- ~~Non-interactive ClockstaR~~

- Dirichlet process prior to cluster trees

- Option to use branch lengths as dimensions, in addition to the sBSDmin. Note that using branch lengths as dimensions does not work for data sets with few genes. This is a form of a 'curse of dimensionality'.
