ClockstaR2
=========
Update tutorial and complete documentation in this branch or in src_test
Write the documentation in the ClockstaR2 folder

This is a re-write version of ClockstaR. This version should only depend on APE and cluster. Optionally, it can use doParallel and foreach. This does not include clockstar for genomic data sets

list of functions to replace and brief description:

- ~~plot.partitions~~

- ~~clockstar.interactive. This is a function to run the program interactively. It should only require a file with multiple trees~~

- ~~Include a function to optimise the trees in R. This can be a standalone script because it depends in phangorn~~
