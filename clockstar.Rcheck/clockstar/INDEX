clockstar-package       ClockstaR: Selecting partitioning strategies
                        for relaxed phylogenetic analysis
convert.to.fasta        This function is used to convert nexus files to
                        fasta format for clockstar execution
cut.trees.beta          cut.trees.beta calculated the diameter of a
                        dendrogram. If the diameter of the dendrogram
                        is higher than that specified by the user, the
                        dendrogram is cut at its longest edge.

get.all.groups          This function finds the best number of
                        partitions (k) for a data set, and the data
                        subsets in each partitions, as described in
                        Duchene et al.
get.all.groups.k        This function finds the best partitioning
                        strategy for a fixed number of partitions, as
                        described in Duchene et al.
min.dist.topo           This function estimates the sBSDmin value
                        described in Duchene et al.
min.dist.topo.mat       Estimate the pairwise BSDmin for a list of
                        trees
min.dist.topo.mat.para
                        Estimate the pairwise BSDmin for a list of
                        trees
optim.edge.lengths      This function estimates the branch lengths of a
                        fixed tree topology for multiple alignment data
                        sets stored in a folder.
run.clockstar           This function is wrapper for the individual
                        ClockstaR functions. It uses a folder that
                        contains the individual gene alignments and the
                        phylogenetic tree to calculate the BSDmin
                        distance.
